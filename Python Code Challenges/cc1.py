""" Your Challenge:
Turn line 1 into a comment.
There are two errors in line 3. Here is a hint for one of the errors: When you use pairs of quotes to indicate a string, you can use single or double quotes, as long as you use the same kind for both the start quote and the end quote. 
Read lines 5 and 6, which demonstrate declaring a variable named a and assigning to it a value with an integer data type, then printing its data type to the screen. 
On line 8, write code to declare a variable named b and assign to it any value of your choice with a float data type. Then on line 9, write code to print the variable b's data type to the screen.
On line 11, declare a variable named c and assign to it any value of your choice with a string data type. Then also print its data type to the screen on line 12. 
On line 14, declare a variable named d and assign to it the value of a plus b. On line 15, print the value stored in the variable d to the screen. Note, you should print the actual value of d rather than its data type. 
Finally, open the integrated terminal in Visual Studio Code. You can do this either by going to the View menu and selecting Terminal, or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl/Control + ` <-- this character is a backtick character, not a single quote, and you can find it just below your Esc button at the top left of your keyboard.
